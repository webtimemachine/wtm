## Server status

Keep track of system operations and incident history by checking the [Server Status](https://thewebtimemachine.cronitorstatus.com/). Stay informed about our platform's performance and any ongoing issues.

## Backend

The backend is a Python API. Check the following guides to run a local backend, or deploy your own version to Vercel.

- [Run the Python API locally](./server/README.md#run-the-project-locally)
- [Deploy the Python API to Vercel](./server/README.md#deploying-the-project-to-vercel)

## Browser Extension

The browser Extension for Safari and Chrome is built using [React](https://react.dev/). Leveraging React allows us to develop and maintain the extensions efficiently, while also benefiting from a dynamic ecosystem of libraries, tools, and community support.
