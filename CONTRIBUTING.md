# Contribution Guidelines

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use feature branches and the PR to master
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/webtimemachine/wtm/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/webtimemachine/wtm/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and an example
When reporting a bug, please provide a clear description of the expected behavior and the actual behavior you encountered. Adding an example could be usefull.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
We're using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages.
